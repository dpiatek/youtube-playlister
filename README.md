# Youtube Playlister

Watch and modify a in-browser (not youtube) playlist. No sign-in or backend.

Things are still pretty basic, features I want to add are:
- localStorage persistance
- drag and drop for playlist items
- remove bootstrap from dependecies
- create a production enviroment (minify files etc)
